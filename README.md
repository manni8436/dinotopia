[Here is a link to the live final project]()

## INITIAL IDEA
My initial idea behind Dinotopia is to make a eCommerce site about Dinosaurs, where anyone will be able to purchase their own
Dinosaur, including eggs, young dinosaurs, adult dinosaurs, old dinosaurs and fossils. The site is being designed to be responsive
for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The user will be able to navigate easily throughout the site, and the site will be fully accessible for all users.

## USER EXPERIENCE

### USER STORIES

The structure of the site was designed to be simple and easy to use. It has a good balance of images and content, so 
it does not overload the user, while giving them enough information about the products that they are planning to purchase
and doesn't leave the user needing more information to carry out all steps needed on the site.

* The website is for the following user types:
  * Users who are curious at looking at Dinosaurs, what they looked like and have been recommended this site.
  * Users who are browsing to look for their first purchase.
  * Users who are going to make their next purchase and increase their personal collection.
  * Users who are browsing to purchase something as a gift.
  * Users who are looking to make a bulk purchases if they require.

#### CLIENT GOALS

* The site needs to be easily accesible.
* The navigation menu needs to be simple to use on a range of devices, including desktop, tablet and mobile.
* Manoeuvering around the site should be simple and straightforward.
* To be able to create an user account.

* The site should be informative and all the text should be easy to read.

## DESIGN

### FONTS

### COLOR THEME

These colors were chosen to connect to a jungle theme. The green has been used to resemble leaves, and the brown resembles the tree trunks and/or ground. This relates to the way that the Dinosaurs lived in the wild. Black was using for form borders and also in the case the background image fails to load correctly, Lastly the `#28A745` shade of green was used for the hover affect and white was chosen as to make the content stand out and be easily readable, ensuring full AAA WCAG colour contrast compliance.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used for version control by using the Gitpod terminal to add and commit to Git and push to Github.

#### GitPod

[GitPod](https://gitpod.io) was used as an IDE whilst coding this site.

#### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is being used to store all the code for this project after being pushed from GitPod, which I also used a Project board to 
keep track of the project development by splitting tasks into smaller and more managable sections.

[Heroku]()

[AWS]()

[Favicon](https://favicon.io/) was used to create a favicon image that was added to the website.

#### Google Fonts

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) was used for all the text content on the site pages.

[Coolors]()

#### Am i Responsive

[Am i Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) was used to create the image in my [Final Design](#final-design) section.

#### Firefox Developer Tools

[Firefox Developer](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/developer/) Tools was used for troubleshooting and trying new visual changes without it affecting the current code.

## SOLVED BUGS

1. During the development process a bug was found causing my dropdown menu button on mobile and tablet devices to stop working, when initially the dropdown button was working, after closer inspection on this issue, it turned out that I had changed and I had imported the wrong script, which was rectified by changing the script to the one below.

![dropdown menu bug](static/docs/images/readme-images/dropdown-menu-bug.png)

2. While working on my order successful functionality, I came across the error below after filling in the order form and pressing the complete order button.

![numeric field overflow error](static/docs/images/readme-images/numeric-field-overflow-error.png)

After looking at the error closely, I connected the numbers that were provided on the error screen with the `max_digits` values that I had in the `lineitem_total` inside the `OrderLineItem` class in the `models.py` file.

![line item total code](static/docs/images/readme-images/numeric-field-overflow-bug-1.png)

From the image above, I made two changes, my first change was `max_digit=6` to `max_digit=10` and my second change was `decimal_places=2` to `decimal_places=4`, after making these changes, it solved my issue.
