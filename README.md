## INITIAL IDEA
My initial idea behind Dinotopia is to make a eCommerce site about Dinosaurs, where anyone will be able to purchase their own
Dinosaur, including eggs, young dinosaurs, adult dinosaurs, old dinosaurs and fossils. The site is being designed to be responsive
for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. The user will be able to navigate easily throughout the site, and the site will be fully accessible for all users.

## DESIGN

### FONTS

### COLOR THEME

These colors were chosen to connect to a jungle theme. The green has been used to resemble leaves, and the brown resembles the tree trunks and/or ground. This relates to the way that the Dinosaurs lived in the wild. White was chosen as to make the content stand out and be easily readable, ensuring full AAA WCAG colour contrast compliance.
